# Words widget

Create a widget that allows a user to enter a sentence of 5 or more words. When the user clicks a button the sentence should be analyzed.

The widget: 

* should **highlight** any word that is **longer than 4 characters**,
* and show **how many words** are in the sentence.

Select a decent color sceme for your widget from [coolors](https://coolors.co/).

Once the above functionality is working. Deploy your widget to GitHub pages.

And email a link to `gwi-mentors@projectcodex.co`.

Now move on and add the features below.
## Hide & highlight

There should be an option to hide all words shorter than 5 characters. Use a checkbox.

Highlight the longest word/s in the sentence.

## Keep track

Keep track of the last 5 sentences entered and show them on the screen. If you click on any of these sentences details for it should be shown as if it was the sentence that was typed in.

Keep track of the average length of words in the last 5 sentences.
Show for the latest sentence entered if it's average word length is higher or lower than the last 5 sentences by displaying a `green` dot if higher and an `orange` dot if lower.

## Adding configuration & storage

Make the word limit a variable number using a slider/text element. If the world limit is 0 no words should be highlighted and nothing should be shown for the entered sentence.

Store the last 5 sentences in `localStorage` - reload data after refreshing the screen.
